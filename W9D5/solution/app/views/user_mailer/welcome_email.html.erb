  <p>What seems to have been lost, then, is only the principal moment,  viz. the simple fact of having independentsubsistence for  consciousness. But, in reality, self−consciousness is reflexion out of  the bare being thatbelongs to the world of sense and perception, and  is essentially the return out of otherness. As self−consciousness, it  is movement. But when it distinguishes only its self as such from  itself, distinction isstraightway taken to be superseded in the sense  of involving otherness. The distinction is not, andself−consciousness  is only motionless tautology, Ego is Ego, I am I. When for  self−consciousness thedistinction does not also have the shape of  being, it is not self−consciousness. For  self−consciousness, then,otherness is a fact, it does exist as a distinct moment; but the unity  of itself with this difference is also a factfor self−consciousness,  and is a second distinct moment. With that first moment,  self−consciousness occupiesthe position of consciousness, and the  whole expanse of the world of sense is conserved as its object, but atthe same time only as related to the second moment, the unity of  self−consciousness with itself. And,consequently, the sensible world  is regarded by self−consciousness as having a subsistence which is,however, only appearance, or forms a distinction from  self−consciousness that per se has no being. Thisopposition of its  appearance and its truth finds its real essence, however, only in the  truth−−in the unity ofself−consciousness with itself. This unity must  become essential to self−consciousness, i.e.self−consciousness is the  state of Desire in general. Consciousness has, qua self−consciousness,  henceforth atwofold object−−the one immediate, the object of  sense−certainty and of perception, which, however, is herefound to be  marked by the character of negation; the second, viz. itself, which is  the true essence, and is found in the first instance only in the  opposition of the first object to it. Self−consciousness presents  itselfhere as the process in which this opposition is removed, and  oneness or identity with itself established. -G.W.F. Hegel, The Phenemenology of Mind</p>
